Firstly, after adding the given dataset to the mySql workbench, I selected the requested
columns of the table using the following query:

SELECT *
FROM `finance_liquor_sales`
WHERE date BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2019-12-31';

Next, I exported the data to a CSV file as instructed.

Using PyCharm, I went on and uploaded the CSV data file to the correct
folder in order to gain access to it through my project.

By following the aforementioned steps, all was set for writing the main code for the assignment.

I chose Matplotlib instead of Tableau, because I personally find it to be more flexible and easier to debug
or edit.

In the main.py, I start the process by importing the needed packages, which I had previously installed. I import
pandas as well as matplotlib in order to create the scatter chart that is requested.

Next, I proceed by loading the CSV file with the selection of data from 2016 to 2019 and by convert the 'date' column
to a datetime format (because otherwise there was an error in the data type, which is one of the main difficulties I faced).
I then filter the data for years between 2016 and 2019. Here I had to adjust the name 'date'
in order for it to be aligned with the used terms in the CSV file.

Afterwards, it is needed to group the data by zip code and calculate the total bottles sold, as well as
create a scatter chart of the number of bottles sold per zip code. In the scatter chart, I add colour based on the number of
bottles sold for a more understandable representation of the data.

Finally, I set the title and axis labels and display the plot.
